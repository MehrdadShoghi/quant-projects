## 🚀 Executive Summary

This case study evaluates the efficacy of the **RouletteMM** library when applied to a standard trend-following strategy on **XAUUSD (Gold)**. By employing a **Positive Progression** money management model with **Cycle Targets** and **Flattening**, the system aims to maximize gains during winning streaks while minimizing drawdown during unfavorable market conditions.

The backtest results demonstrate a massive improvement in **Net Profit** (approx. 5x increase) and **Recovery Factor** compared to the baseline fixed-lot strategy.

## 📉 Comparative Analysis (Before vs. After)

### 1. Before Money Management (Fixed Lot)
The baseline strategy shows steady but slower growth. Without the compounding effect of RouletteMM, the equity curve is linear, and the total net profit is significantly lower.

### 2. After RouletteMM (Positive Progression)
With **RouletteMM** enabled, the equity curve becomes exponential. The system capitalizes on winning streaks (clusters) by increasing lot sizes, while the "Flattening" mechanism protects capital during drawdowns.

## 🗝️ Key Takeaways

1.  **Exponential Growth:** The system transformed a modest ~$4k profit (implied from baseline) into over **$20k**, a 500% improvement.
2.  **Risk Mitigation:** The **Flattening** feature prevented consecutive losses from deeply impacting the principal capital, keeping Max Drawdown near 10%.
3.  **Robustness:** The consistent performance over a nearly 2-year period (2024-2025) on the H1 timeframe suggests the logic is highly adaptable to Gold's volatility.
