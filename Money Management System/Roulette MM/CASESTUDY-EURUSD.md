## 🚀 Executive Summary

This case study evaluates the efficacy of the **RouletteMM** library when applied to a standard reversion strategy on **EURUSD**. By employing a **Positive Progression** money management model with **Cycle Targets** and **Flattening**, the system aims to maximize gains during winning streaks while minimizing drawdown during unfavorable market conditions.

The backtest results demonstrate a significant improvement in **Net Profit** (nearly 4x increase) and **Recovery Factor** compared to the baseline fixed-lot strategy, proving the system works even with win rates below 50%.

### 2. After RouletteMM (Positive Progression)
With **RouletteMM** enabled, the equity curve shifts to an exponential trajectory. The system leverages "clusters" of wins to aggressively compound profits, while the "Flattening" mechanism keeps the drawdown under control relative to the massive gains.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The following data is derived from the Strategy Tester report using the RouletteMM logic:

| Metric | Value | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Net Profit** | **$27,164.35** | Massive return on the initial $10k deposit (approx. 271% gain), compared to just 70% without MM. |
| **Profit Factor** | **1.55** | Indicates a highly robust edge, generating $1.55 for every $1 lost. |
| **Recovery Factor** | **11.02** | Exceptional recovery capability. The system recovers from drawdowns 11x faster than it creates them. |
| **Total Trades** | **414** | Statistically significant sample size over a 2-year period. |
| **Win Rate** | **42.51%** | (176 wins / 414 total). Proves that RouletteMM can generate massive profits even with a sub-50% win rate by capitalizing on R:R. |
| **Max Drawdown** | **9.79%** | ($2,465.98). Risk remains strictly controlled (under 10%) despite the aggressive compounding. |
